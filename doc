# Install and use pip on macOS without sudo / admin access

Most recently tested on macOS Sierra (10.12.6)

1. Download the installation script; `curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py -o ~/Downloads/get-pip.py`
2. Run the installation, appending the `--user` flag; `python ~/Downloads/get-pip.py --user`. pip will be installed to ~/Library/Python/2.7/bin/pip
3. Make sure `~/Library/Python/2.7/bin` is in your `$PATH`. For `bash` users, edit the `PATH=` line in `~/.bashrc` to append the local Python path; ie. `PATH=$PATH:~/Library/Python/2.7/bin`. Apply the changes, `source ~/.bashrc`.
4. Use pip! Remember to append `--user` when installing modules; ie. `pip install <package_name> --user`

## Note

There is much discussion about making the user site the default for installation. See [Issue 1668](https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/1668).
